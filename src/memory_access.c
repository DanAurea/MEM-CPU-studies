 * 	@description This file serve as an educational purpose only
 * 	             it shows how memory access and CPU architecture could
 * 	             imply some performances issues in software.
 * 	             You will see some simple examples on how parallelism 
 * 	             instruction could speed up execution time, how memory 
 * 	             (spatial) locality can mess up your algorithm and 
 * 	             contradict your expectations about some speed improvements.
 * 	             
 * 	             This is just a collection of some searches on internet
 * 	             about optimization, CPU architecture and how CPU cache
 * 	             works.
 * 	             So some portions of code there could be found on web
 * 	             and are either written by someone else and simply rewrited
 * 	             in C or are just interpretations of what I understood from
 * 	             different articles I had read.
 * 	             I will do my best for documenting every examples present in
 * 	             this file.
 *
 * 				 FYI: All examples were tested on a laptop with I5 6300HQ CPU
 * 				 and results could differ from others CPU.
