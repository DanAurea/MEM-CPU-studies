 * 	@description This file serve as an educational purpose only
 * 	             it shows how memory access and CPU architecture could
 * 	             imply some performances issues in software.
 * 	             You will see some simple examples on how parallelism 
 * 	             instruction could speed up execution time, how memory 
 * 	             (spatial) locality can mess up your algorithm and 
 * 	             contradict your expectations about some speed improvements.
 * 	             
 * 	             This is just a collection of some searches on internet
 * 	             about optimization, CPU architecture and how CPU cache
 * 	             works.
 * 	             So some portions of code there could be found on web
 * 	             and are either written by someone else and simply rewrited
 * 	             in C or are just interpretations of what I understood from
 * 	             different articles I had read.
 * 	             I will do my best for documenting every examples present in
 * 	             this file.
 *
 *               FYI: All examples were tested on a laptop with I5 6300HQ CPU
 *               and results could differ from others CPU.

 * Of course this will work only on CPU with cache like x86 architecture
 * and so including cache lines.
 * You can find some useful informations on following url: lwn.net/Articles/255364/
 * about how CPU read datas stored in memory / cache.
 *
 * On our modern CPU / compiler it seems this affirmation is not true now, on my
 * laptop I had those results:
 * 
 * step(1)   = 341.63ms
 * step(2)   = 228.85ms

 * step(64)  = 119.73ms
 * step(128) = 112.56ms
 * step(256) = 109.73ms

 * So newer CPU seems to have a different fetching method resulting in less overhead
